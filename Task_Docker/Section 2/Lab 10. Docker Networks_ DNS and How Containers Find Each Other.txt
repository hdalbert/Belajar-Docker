Lab 10. Docker Networks_ DNS and How Containers Find Each Other

Docker Network : DNS - How container find each other

we can learn :
- Understand how DNS is the key to easy inter-container comms
- See how this works by default with custom networks
- Learn how to use --link to enable DNS on defult bridge network


- Forget IP's
	- Static IP's and using IP's for talking to containers is an anti-patern. Do your best to avoid it.

- Docker DNS
	- Docker DNS has a built-in DNS server that container use by default.

- DNS Default Name
	- Docker default the hostname to the container's name, but you can also aliases


Lab :
- create container baru
	- $ docker container run -d --name my_nginx --network my_app_net nginx

- Verify :
	- $ docker network inspect my_app_net

- Test Ping antar container dari my_nginx ke new_nginx
	- $ docker container exec -ti my_nginx ping new_nginx 

	- Bila muncul error
		OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: container_linux.go:348: starting container process caused "exec: \"ping\": executable file not found in $PATH": unknown

		- solusinya masuk ke bash container
			- apt-update
			- apt install iputils-ping



Docker Networks : DNS

- Containers shouldn't rely on IP's for inter-communication
- DNS for friendly names is built-in if you use custom networks 
- Your using custom network right
- this gets way easier with docker compose in future section
