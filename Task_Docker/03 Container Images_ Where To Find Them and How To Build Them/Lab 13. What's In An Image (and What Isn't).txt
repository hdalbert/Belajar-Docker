### What's in an image (and what's isn't) ###
- App binaries and dependencies
- Metadata about the image data and how to run the image
- Official definition: "An image is an ordered collection of root filesystem change and the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container runtime."
- Not a complete OS. Not kernel, kernel modules (e.g. drivers)
- small as one file (your app binary) like a golang static binary
- big as a Ubuntu distro with apt, and apache, PHP, and more installed
